# Pwn-college-writeup

A collection of writeups for pwn-college challenges — from web exploitation to binary exploitation.
This repo organizes challenge writeups, exploitation notes, and supporting scripts/tools to help you learn and reproduce exploit techniques.

## Purpose

This repository is created **solely for learning and documentation purposes**.

It serves as a personal record of my study process while working through
pwn.college challenges, including my understanding of exploitation techniques,
problem-solving approaches, and notes taken during practice.

All writeups and scripts reflect my own learning journey and are intended to
help me review concepts and track progress over time.
