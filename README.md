# Pwn-college-writeup

A personal collection of security writeups and notes based on my learning
experience with pwn.college, covering topics from web exploitation to
binary exploitation.

---

## Purpose

This repository is created **solely for learning and documentation purposes**.

It serves as a personal record of my study process while working through
pwn.college challenges, including my understanding of vulnerabilities,
exploitation techniques, debugging strategies, and problem-solving approaches.

All writeups and scripts reflect my own learning journey and are intended to
help me review concepts, track progress, and reinforce fundamental security
knowledge over time.

## Structure

The repository is organized by topic to reflect different areas of security
practice:

- **Reverse Engineering**  
  Writeups and notes related to binary analysis, debugging, and exploitation,
  including reverse engineering techniques and low-level program behavior.

- **Web Security**  
  Writeups covering common web vulnerabilities, exploitation methods, and
  security concepts encountered in web-based challenges.

Each directory may contain markdown notes, code snippets, and small scripts
used during analysis and experimentation.
